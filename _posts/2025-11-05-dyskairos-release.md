Hi! If you're reading this, that means [Dyskairos](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3463170) is available now (and you're probably here from the Steam version of this post)! I wanted to do a little overview on what's changed from the demo. If you happened to have read my [Project Roundup](/misc/project-roundup-1) blog post last month, most of this has already been mentioned there.

## Full Game Contents

- 9+ floors (6+ new floors, featuring various secrets, 3 new enemy types)
- 3 endings (can be sequentially done on the same save profile)
- 15 weapons (each with multiple modifications they can spawn with)
- 13 unique abilities (plus 3 always attainable abilities that can be found in specific locations)
- 15 generic upgrades

## Improvements

- Per-save key item spawns: Keycard spawn locations will be changed from save to save, each playthrough will be different!
- Added option to profile creation to use the old always random keycard spawns
- PTRD's bullet can now penetrate
- Damage dealt to bosses is now capped to 65% of their HP in one instance
- Added buttons to upgrade and shuffle the mods of equipped weapons in the shop area (for Coin, of course)
- Added small intro animation at beginning of game
- Recoil curve mechanics for sustained automatic weapon fire
- Card Finder unique upgrade now shows all keycards with increased length

## Misc Changes

- Reload speed generally increased across the board
- PTRD barrel spread multipliers signficantly reduced
- Notifications now appear more quickly after they get triggered
- Wall jump now includes an extra jump by default
- Moved camera recoil into physics process (better for reflex sight and crosshair placement)
- A certain easter egg now displays properly (was in the demo) [^hint]
- Fix clipping Hidden Interface door in Floor 3
- Fixed controller-only prompt icons reverting to Xbox after having previously used a PS controller when current input changes to keyboard
- Blue keycard room's inside button (on the park side of Floor 2) now correctly no longer requires a keycard
- Fixed a transition to a secret area (was in the demo)
- Various other fixes done while finishing the rest of the game

## Future

As I also mentioned in [Project Roundup](/misc/project-roundup-1), I don't have a ton of plans for new content for this game. I've refined the "daily/weekly runs" idea also mentioned into something a bit more concrete, so there will probably be an update in a month or two featuring that.

That's about it for now, I hope you enjoy Dyskairos! Please post in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/ub2DQSS2xE) if you encounter any issues or have any feedback.
