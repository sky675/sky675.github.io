Hi! Dyskairos is nearing its completion so this is a small update to the demo featuring some additional content, some changes, and fixes.

## Update - September 19th

The post on Steam received 3 clicks so I won't bother making this its own post, but I just updated the demo with some quality of life updates:

- Increased rate of crosshair smoothing
- Added default key/button for inventory when "the device" is mentioned in Shopkeep's dialogue
- Added label to inventory that displays the next (intended) objective goal
- Added notification system, appears when picking up a keycard
- Gun Servants now shouldn't shoot while moving (should make them more accurate)
- Gun Servants mini-boss on Floor 1 no longer respawns after being killed once
- Back side of Floor 3 now have different wall textures than the rest of the level
- Stash weapons now persist regardless of death penalty (previously were removed when on hard+)
- Slowed bullets and made them more visible
- Keycards will now only spawn at their first spawn point and will spawn 100% of the time (in the full game, there'll be a per-save seed so that each save will spawn keycards in different locations but it'll be those same positions every time for that save)
- Basic Servants attack more often
- Rebalanced cycle timer: 30 more seconds by default, but consecutive cycles have slightly less added time to them
- 20% less visual recoil (will rebalance and enhance recoil for the full game, this is just for the demo)

## New Weapons

{% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/posts/dys_demoup/ptrd.png" caption="Fun facts: I ended up modeling the PTRD's cartridge as close to its real-life specs as I could (which was then scaled to fit the PTRD I had made). This weapon is also so large this is the best way I could figure out in order to show it (and whats shown isn't the full barrel)." %}

### PTRD

The PTRD, a new Heavy slot weapon shown above, is a single-shot anti-materiel rifle. It will one shot (almost) every enemy in the game, but has very bad spread, slow ADS speed, and a slow reload. Attachments include the Sawn-off Barrel which will increase the ADS speed with a trade-off of even worse hipfire spread. Without any upgrades, it only has a reserve ammo maximum of 3 shots. Because of this and its slow reload time, you'll need to be sure you'll hit your target or have a backup weapon to use once the enemy gets closer.

### T58

Also new in this update is the T58 Carbine. This is a Medium slot automatic rifle based on the Vz.58. With moderately high recoil, you'll need to aim carefully in order to use it effectively.

These two weapons evens the demo's weapon selection out to three for each slot. Expect even more in the full game including a more controllable semi-auto Medium slot rifle, a high capacity pistol, and more! I'm currently aiming for at least 5 weapons per slot in the full release.

## Floor 3

Floor 3 is being added to the demo. This floor more of an exploratory floor and is a little bit of a reprieve after Floor 2's boss fight. There are multiple different ways to access the inner part of the floor, depending on your current upgrades and abilities.

One of the features of this floor is its static Unique Ability that can be found in it: the Card Finder. Like its name implies, it will show you the location of the nearest keycard for a limited amount of time. You can do this once per map per floor per cycle.

## Shop

The Shopkeep's shop is now open! Located in the newly opened second floor outside, here you can buy various randomized weapons, ammo, and upgrades. You can also upgrade aspects of the storage locker (and potentially other things in the full game). In order to buy anything though you'll need Coins, which are gained by finding bags and crates of materials now found in the Tower. 

Turning in these materials will reward you with Coins depending on the material type. These Coins stay with you through death (except for on True Permadeath), so the shop can be used to re-equip yourself more quickly after dying. The materials will not persist on your person through Cycles though. Like keycards, they belong to the Tower so they should be deposited before the current Cycle completes.

## Full Changelog

Here's the full list of everything that's been added or changed since the last demo version as well:

### Additions
- New save system (previous demo version's saves are incompatible, but these saves will be compatible with the full game)
- Added Floor 3 (and things related to it)
- Added PTRD (heavy slot weapon)
- Added T58 (medium slot weapon)
- Added shop and related systems
- Added more tips for tips guy
- Added viewpunch when taking damage
- Uncapped amount of save slots (this is why I removed full controller support)

### Changes
- Keycards no longer get removed when entering a certain secret area
- Minor dialogue changes
- Moved end of demo popup to end of Floor 3
- Reduced default music volume

### Fixes
- Improved spawn closet door opening timing (In Floor 2's boss fight, spawning servants will now more consistently enter the arena)
- Fixed boss bar not appearing correctly sometimes
- Fixed floating Gun Servants
- Probably other things I didn't keep good track of

## Future

This update is also being released ahead of October's Next Fest, where the game will be participating, so look out for the demo in that! As I mentioned in [the first OASIS 2 Dev-Blog](/oasis/oasis2-devblog-1), I'm still not 100% sure when the full game will release. I'm aiming for some time in early November. 

I also wanted to mention that I participated in the GMTK Game Jam again this year at the start of August and you can check out what we made [here!](https://sky675.itch.io/iterations) I'm very happy with what we made and we both have more ideas for it, so you might end up seeing it updated maybe :)

Thank you for your support! Again, please let me know what you think of the demo in Discord!
