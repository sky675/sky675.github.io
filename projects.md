# Projects

i've got two publicly released projects that i'd consider "major", with 1 more in the works that might be too early to show much of publicly (it doesn't even have a name really decided for it yet). you can check them out below.

## Stalker RP (Garry's Mod)

the first project is a "roleplay" gamemode for the game Garry's Mod, based on the STALKER game series. there are a few of these out there but the specific one i'm talking about is the one i made [here](https://github.com/sky675/srpv5) with a friend of mine, based on the framework NutScript.

its got a bit of history behind it, so if you happen to want to know about its history and its development, well, i had originally planned to write a page out describe its history, but decided not to for now, sorry. however {% comment %} check out [this page here](/srp.md) - {% endcomment %} it took around 4-5 years and - as you could maybe guess if you checked out the name of the repo - 5 versions to get that from its beginning to where it is now. from around 2017 to 2021. 

as it ended, oasis began taking shape. this is primarily here because many decisions in it and in previous gamemode schemas i made ended up influencing some of the decisions i made for the game.

## OASIS: Tokyo

the second and more recent one is the main focus of content (as little of it as there is) on this site right now. 

it's a fps game that was initially inspired by the shadowrun trilogy but has since grown into what i'd like to believe is its own thing, with further inspiration from games like payday, tarkov, stalker, cyberpunk, and more. it's finished, however i still plan to update it for a bit, though my focus is beginning to slowly shift over more to my new project.

of course, oasis also has a bit of history behind it, so if you wanna learn about that and some fun facts about its development, you can check out this page again maybe later, i was originally going to write a page about it but i couldn't finish it in time. sorry, check back in a few weeks.

## Third Project (Tower)
my newest project has a working name of "Tower". this began as an attempt at learning godot after a certain scandal related to unity in late 2023, and frankly i ended up liking godot more than i liked unity, so this has turned into more of an actual thing. i'm also doing this project to learn 3d modelling more, as i feel like i've relied too much on assets in oasis.

the gameplay still isn't finished, but the idea is a fps with a timed cycle where you - as you could maybe guess by its working name - are working towards climbing up a tower, with some metroidvania and roguelike elements on top. current inspirations for this game include stalker and the ps1 game baroque. 

my current plan for this is to create a demo/prototype/vertical slice with the first 2 floors, and release it to try and gauge interest in the idea. this should end up being released sometime this year, unless i get horribly knocked off schedule.
