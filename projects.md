# Projects

Here are the projects I've worked on or am currently working on.

## Stalker RP (Garry's Mod)

This is a "roleplay" gamemode for the game Garry's Mod, based on the STALKER game series. There are a few of these out there but the specific one I'm talking about is the one I made [here](https://github.com/sky675/srpv5) with a [friend of mine](https://github.com/NateStanley), based on the framework NutScript. I'm adding this here because I consider it a monumental project for me, and a culmination of over 5 years of development. Not including NutScript itself, any of the addons in the repo, or Nate's UI code, I'd say about 90% of whats in that schema folder is my own code (the rest are plugins from various places).

It has quite a bit of history behind it, not much of it is too relevant nowadays though. It took around 5+ years and - as you could maybe guess if you checked out the name of the repo - 5 versions to get that from its beginning to where it is now. The first version was made in around early 2017, and this most recent version was made in 2021. 

As the server it was being ran on ended, OASIS already had began taking shape. Another reason this is here because many decisions in it and previous roleplay gamemodes I had put together ended up influencing some of the decisions I made for OASIS.

## OASIS: Tokyo

This is my first commercially released project.

It's an FPS game that was initially inspired by the Shadowrun trilogy of games but has since grown into what I'd like to believe is its own thing, with further inspiration from games like Payday, Tarkov, Stalker, Cyberpunk, and more. I like the little cyberpunk-ish world I've made for it and absolutely intend to return to that world in a few years.

Of course, OASIS also has a bit of history behind it, so if you wanna learn about that and maybe some fun facts about the development of it, you can check out this [blog post](/oasis/the-history-of-oasis/) I made about it.


## Dyskairos

My newest project, formerly called "The Tower". This began as an attempt at learning Godot after *a certain scandal* related to Unity in late 2023, and frankly I ended up liking using Godot more than I liked Unity, so this has turned into a real project. I'm also doing this project to learn 3D modeling more, as I feel like I relied too much on asset packs in OASIS.

In the game you climb a mysterious tower with the goal of finding an important item on one of the upper floors. It's an FPS with a couple of metroidvania and roguelike elements on top. Current major inspirations for the game include Stalker and the PS1/Saturn game Baroque.

Currently I've released a demo with the first 2 floors available on my itch and the intended release date will likely be in late 2025, with an updated version of the demo during the June edition of Nextfest.

## Koi

This is a little side project I've been working on. I don't have too much to show about it right now. I started working on it out of a desire for an open source/moddable call of duty-type game with bots (which afaik at least doesn't exist, ravenfield is probably the closest that exists but its more of a battlefield-type game than a cod-type game). This won't exactly be it (it currently doesn't have multiplayer support), but it'll be enough for me lol. This is also the first step to an OASIS 2, the bots and other underlying systems here will likely be used as a base when I start working on that. 

The end goal for the gameplay loop for this is something with the team management of UT2004's singleplayer campaign, but with a more "modern" sports-style season system. When its further along, I'll likely upload it to itch and make the repo for it public, as well as make modding guides for it should anyone want to make content for it. (as an aside, im also considering making bot warfare-type videos using it, let me know if youd be interested in watching something like that please)
