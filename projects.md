# Projects

i've got two publicly released projects that i'd consider "major", with 1 more in the works that might be too early to show much of publicly (it doesn't even have a name really decided for it yet). you can check them out below.

## Stalker RP (Garry's Mod)

the first project is a "roleplay" gamemode for the game Garry's Mod, based on the STALKER game series. there are a few of these out there but the specific one i'm talking about is the one i made [here](https://github.com/sky675/srpv5) with a [friend of mine](https://github.com/NateStanley), based on the framework NutScript. i'm adding this here because i consider it a monumental project for me, and a culmination of about 5 years of development. not including nutscript itself, any of the addons in the repo, or nate's ui code, id say about 90% of whats in that schema folder is my own code.

its got quite a bit of history behind it, not much of it is too relevant nowadays though. it took around 4-5 years and - as you could maybe guess if you checked out the name of the repo - 5 versions to get that from its beginning to where it is now. the first version was made in around early 2017, and this most recent version was made in 2021. 

as it ended, oasis already had began taking shape. another reason this is here because many decisions in it and in previous roleplay gamemodes i had put together ended up influencing some of the decisions i made for oasis.

## OASIS: Tokyo

the second and more recent one is the main focus of content (as little of it as there is) on this site right now. 

it's a fps game that was initially inspired by the shadowrun trilogy but has since grown into what i'd like to believe is its own thing, with further inspiration from games like payday, tarkov, stalker, cyberpunk, and more. i like the little cyberpunk-ish world ive made for it and absolutely intend to return to that world some day.

of course, oasis also has a bit of history behind it, so if you wanna learn about that and some fun facts about its development, you can check out this page again maybe later, i'll finish the page for its history eventually.

## Dyskairos

my newest project, formerly called "The Tower". this began as an attempt at learning godot after a certain scandal related to unity in late 2023, and frankly i ended up liking godot more than i liked unity, so this has turned into more of an actual thing. i'm also doing this project to learn 3d modeling more, as i feel like i've relied too much on asset packs in oasis.

in the game you climb a mysterious tower with the goal of finding an important item on one of the upper floors. it's an fps with a couple of metroidvania and roguelike elements on top. current major inspirations for the game include stalker and the ps1/saturn game baroque. i'm trying to go for a bit of an opaque game, where there isn't much directly told to you aside from whats needed to get you going. you learn the map of the floor by exploring, and then you find a route through the floor in order to find a keycard to get further up using the various upgrades you found while exploring and learning the map. 

currently ive released a demo with the first 2 floors available on itch and the intended release date will likely be in late 2025 with probably a nextfest version of the demo sometime during that year.
