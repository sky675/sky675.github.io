# unity beginnings

my programming/game design journey largely began with making items for a garry's mod roleplay server i was involved with in 2012, but in 2015 i began experimenting with unity. one of the first projects i made with it, named "fpsproj", is oasis' earliest ancestor. it was a roguelike-ish survival game, in which you tried to go through as many preset, randomly created, rooms as possible. since i was still working with gmod during that time, and i was still learning, i dropped it to work on new projects, some more iterations on that same idea, some being completely different

{maybe a video about past projects? idk lmao}

# gmod oasis

id like to say this is where oasis itself actually began, but it actually began a few months before the end of 2017, when i played the shadowrun trilogy. those were games the initial inspiration for oasis, particularly the way in dragonfall where you get on the train to go to missions just kinda sparked something in me.

a few months into 2018, i began work on the oasis gmod gamemode, now known to me as the oasis prototype. this featured largely the same features of oasis today, procedurally generated missions at preset locations detached from the main map, weapons with their own magazine items, cyberware, losing your items on death, etc. 

i should mention that these some of these things werent created specifically for this gamemode. weapons with item magazines first originated while developing a "zombie" rp server i made with my friends (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QzpgOPzgL4 (past the first minute mark in this video i just start wandering around shooting stuff, dont rly need to watch past that)). the "armor protection" vests and higher-tier enemies have in oasis today is technically based on the system i recreated for srpv5, but this version had a similar system as well, which was originally made for the first srp version (in early 2017)

this gamemode also featured a few other things not found in oasis today, since this was kinda initially intended to be a new server. sectcom npcs would walk around the hub world, and if you attacked them or another player, they would aggro on you. since this was sorta built as a rp server (as an afterthought tbh) there was also a sectcom faction aside from the main faction and a few other factions that werent really fleshed out (one of them turned into the suits faction in oasis though). 

there was also a underground sewer portion of the main map, which could be used to loot free items, but was inhabited by zombie robots (these were literally fallout 4 synths using cod zombies animations, since, again, this was gmod lol). this turned into the initial level in the oasis hunt endgame and the zombie robots found in there and the survival extra mode. 

money was also an actual item in the schema (in the same vein as tarkov), it could be deposited at atms around the main map, but you needed a physical credstick to buy from vendors. this was initially implemented into oasis but i scrapped it after a while, the loose credstick items that give you money now use the model the physical credsticks used.

i launched the server for the gamemode in jan of 2019. it lasted about a month. after it died, i initially was working on a completely custom map to use for it (the map that was being used was a version of city 8 i edited), but after a little bit i decided it would be better to start using unity to get around some of gmod's limitations (primarily the map limit, since "missions" in this gamemode took place in detached parts of the map you were teleported to). this would be the first standalone version, but it would be put on the backburner after i started development on srpv4/5.

# first standalone prototype

the first non-gmod version was a bit different than the one it was today, it was originally intended to be a recreation of the original gmod gamemode itself, so it featured a static map (with some random elements) that procedurally generated objectives were placed on. eventually, after bricking the project while trying to add multiplayer (in hindsight it probably wasnt actually irreversably broken, but it was prob for the best tbh), i began to start over in 2020, which would end up becoming the first game i've released (this one).

# the oasis that released

this new version i decided to do things a bit differently, using an art style that was new to me but i could definitely make my own assets for if necessary. i also decided itd be better if mission maps were procedurally generated. over time i made more and more decisions that ultimately detached this from the original gmod gamemode, making it its own little thing.
while im proud ive what ive released and im happy with it, it is definitely not perfect. regardless, ive learned a lot from it and i'm excited to bring that new knowledge into whatever new project im working on next and continuing to learn.
